## Overview

Flow Companion implements a 5-tier memory architecture based on MongoDB's Agent Memory Framework. Each memory type serves a distinct purpose and is evaluated across 4 capabilities.

---

## Memory Framework

### 5 Memory Types

| Type | Collection | TTL | Purpose | Example |
|------|------------|-----|---------|---------|
| **Working Memory** | short_term | 2hr | Current context, task focus | "Currently viewing AgentOps project" |
| **Episodic Memory** | long_term | ∞ | Action history (what happened) | "Completed debugging task at 2pm" |
| **Semantic Memory** | long_term | ∞ | Preferences (what I know about user) | "User prefers Voice Agent project" |
| **Procedural Memory** | long_term | ∞ | Rules (how to act) | "When user says 'done', complete task" |
| **Shared Memory** | shared | 5min | Agent handoffs, coordination | "Retrieval found task X → Worklog" |

### 4 Capabilities (AR, TTL, LRU, CR)

| Capability | Abbreviation | What It Tests | Difficulty |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **Accurate Retrieval** | AR | Find specific info from memory | Medium |
| **Test-Time Learning** | TTL | Learn new rules/preferences during conversation | Medium |
| **Long-Range Understanding** | LRU | Summarize across many turns/sessions | Hard |
| **Conflict Resolution** | CR | Handle contradictory/updated info | Very Hard |

**Research Finding:** Multi-hop conflict resolution is hardest (<7% accuracy in benchmarks).

---

## Test Cases by Memory Type

### 6.1 Working Memory (Session Context)

**Purpose:** Remember context within a conversation session. Resets on session end.

#### Test 6.1.1: Accurate Retrieval - Single-Hop (AR-SH)

```
Settings:
☑ Working Memory: ON
☑ Context Injection: ON
```

| Step | Action | Expected | Capability | Pass |
|------|--------|----------|------------|------|
| 1 | "Show me the AgentOps project" | Shows AgentOps | Setup | □ |
| 2 | "What's high priority?" | Filters to AgentOps high-priority | AR | □ |
| 3 | Check debug panel | "Context injected: ✅" | Verify | □ |

#### Test 6.1.2: Accurate Retrieval - Multi-Hop (AR-MH)

| Step | Action | Expected | Capability | Pass |
|------|--------|----------|------------|------|
| 1 | "Show me AgentOps" | Context: AgentOps | Setup | □ |
| 2 | "Start the debugging task" | Context: AgentOps + task | Setup | □ |
| 3 | "What am I working on?" | "debugging task in AgentOps" | AR-MH | □ |

#### Test 6.1.3: Conflict Resolution - Single-Hop (CR-SH)

| Step | Action | Expected | Capability | Pass |
|------|--------|----------|------------|------|
| 1 | "Show me AgentOps" | Context: AgentOps | Setup | □ |
| 2 | "Actually, switch to Voice Agent" | Context updated | CR | □ |
| 3 | "What's high priority?" | Voice Agent priorities | CR-SH | □ |

#### Test 6.1.4: Context Lost (Memory OFF)

```
Settings:
☐ Working Memory: OFF
☐ Context Injection: OFF
```

| Step | Action | Expected | Pass |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | Clear memory, refresh | Clean state | □ |
| 2 | "Show me AgentOps" | Shows AgentOps | □ |
| 3 | "What's high priority?" | ALL high-priority OR asks "which project?" | □ |

**Key Insight:** Difference between 6.1.3 and 6.1.4 demonstrates Working Memory value.

| 3 | "What's my current focus?" | Voice Agent (not AgentOps) | CR | □ |

#### Test 6.3.4: Preferences Unavailable (Memory OFF)

```
Settings:
☐ Semantic Memory: OFF
```

| Step | Action | Expected | Pass |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| 1 | "I'm focusing on Voice Agent" | Acknowledged but not stored | □ |
| 2 | New session | - | □ |
| 3 | "What's my current focus?" | Doesn't know | □ |

### 6.5 Shared Memory (Agent Handoffs)

**Purpose:** Allow agents to pass context without re-searching. Short TTL (5 min).

#### Test 6.5.1: Agent Handoff

```
Settings:
☑ Shared Memory: ON
```

| | - Shared Memory write | | □ |
| | - complete_task (Worklog Agent) | | □ |
| | - Shared Memory read | | □ |
| | - "Agent Handoff: ✅" | | □ |

#### Test 6.5.2: Handoff Diagram

Debug panel should show:
```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────┐
│Retrieval │───▶│Shared Memory │───▶│ Worklog  │
│  Agent   │    │   (5min TTL) │    │  Agent   │
└──────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────┘
```

## Memory Toggle Combinations

| Working | Episodic | Semantic | Procedural | Shared | Expected Behavior |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full memory, best experience |
| ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Context works, no learning |
| ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | No session context, has history |
| ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Stateless, every turn fresh |

---

## Memory Timing Overhead

Record memory operation times:

| Operation | Expected | Actual | Pass |
|-----------|----------|--------|------|
| Working Memory read | <20ms | ___ms | □ |
| Working Memory write | <20ms | ___ms | □ |
| Episodic Memory read | <30ms | ___ms | □ |
| Episodic Memory write | <50ms | ___ms | □ |
| Semantic Memory read | <30ms | ___ms | □ |
| Semantic Memory write | <50ms | ___ms | □ |
| Procedural Memory read | <30ms | ___ms | □ |
| Procedural Memory write | <50ms | ___ms | □ |
| Shared Memory read | <15ms | ___ms | □ |
| Shared Memory write | <15ms | ___ms | □ |

**Key Insight:** Memory overhead should be negligible compared to LLM time (6-12s).

## Demo Script Integration

### Memory Demo Sequence (for 09-demo-dry-run.md)

```
□ "Show me AgentOps"              → Working Memory stores context
□ "What's high priority?"         → Working Memory filters (AR)

□ [Toggle Working Memory OFF]
□ "What's high priority?"         → Context lost, shows all

□ [Toggle Working Memory ON]
□ "I'm focusing on Voice Agent"   → Semantic Memory stores preference (TTL)
□ "What should I do?"             → Uses preference

□ "What did I complete today?"    → Episodic Memory query (LRU)

□ "I finished the checkpointer"   → Watch Shared Memory handoff
```
